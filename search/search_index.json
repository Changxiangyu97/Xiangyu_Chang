The conceptual framework is a closed cyber-physical loop, including physical structures (i.e., tunnels and physical testbed), cyber counterparts (i.e., surrogate models and physical-based deep learning models), and two interfaces (i.e., information and intervention). The information interface is extracted by smart sensing systems and multi-fidelity model data from physical tunnels and fed into digital models. The intervention is generated by cyber counterparts and applied on physical tunnels. It is evaluated and selected by engineers for optimized predictive maintenance and rail traffic management.</p>"},{"location":"research/research2/","title":"CV-based model updating techniques","text":""},{"location":"research/research2/#structural-evaluation-of-cracked-shield-tunnels-using-computer-vision-based-model-updating-techniques","title":"Structural evaluation of cracked shield tunnels using computer-vision-based model updating techniques","text":"<p>This research presents a novel computer-vision-based framework for evaluating structural damage in cracked shield tunnels by integrating image analysis with finite element (FE) model updating. The method uses the pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to segment tunnel components and a newly developed Dual VMamba U-Net (DVMamba-UNet) to detect cracks and generate detailed crack masks. Geometric analysis techniques then align image-derived damage information with FE models, allowing automatic updates that represent varying damage levels. Two case studies\u2014one with a full tunnel segment image and another with a partial image\u2014demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately detect and model cracks, assess residual structural capacity, and outperform existing crack detection networks. The study highlights its potential for semi-automated, efficient, and scalable tunnel condition assessment, with strong applicability to Digital Twin frameworks for infrastructure monitoring and management</p>"},{"location":"research/research3/","title":"Back-analysis method of rock mass properties","text":""},{"location":"research/research3/#back-analysis-of-rock-mass-parameters-in-tunnel-engineering-using-machine-learning-techniques","title":"Back analysis of rock mass parameters in tunnel engineering using machine learning techniques","text":"<p>This research proposes a new back analysis method to improve the estimation of rock mass parameters in tunnel engineering by combining multi-output support vector regression (MSVR) with a differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Traditional back analysis approaches are often time-consuming and rely mainly on displacement data, which limits accuracy. The authors enhance prediction by integrating multiple monitoring data types (vault settlement, convergence, and rock mass stress) with numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters. The DE algorithm optimizes MSVR hyperparameters, and the method is validated using data from the Yangshan high-speed railway tunnel. Results show that DE-MSVR achieves higher prediction accuracy than existing models and other optimization techniques, particularly when using mixed monitoring data. The study demonstrates that reliable rock mass properties can be estimated even at early excavation stages, though it notes limitations such as the small dataset and lack of dynamic factor consideration</p>"},{"location":"research/research4/","title":"Tunnel deformation prediction","text":""},{"location":"research/research4/#bayesian-prediction-of-tunnel-convergence-combining-empirical-model-and-relevance-vector-machine","title":"Bayesian prediction of tunnel convergence combining empirical model and relevance vector machine","text":"<p>This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for predicting tunnel convergence that combines empirical models (EMs), Bayesian estimation, and the relevance vector machine (RVM). Convergence monitoring is essential for ensuring tunnel safety, but traditional numerical models require difficult-to-obtain geological parameters, while empirical models\u2014though simple and efficient\u2014often lack accuracy in complex, nonlinear conditions. To address this, the authors first apply Bayesian estimation with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to optimize EM parameters and quantify uncertainties, selecting the most accurate EM. Then, RVM is used to model and correct residuals from the EM predictions, improving accuracy. Using data from the Yangshan high-speed railway tunnel in China, the proposed EM\u2013Bayesian\u2013RVM approach reduced root-mean-squared errors by over 90% compared with standalone EMs and outperformed Gaussian process regression and backpropagation neural networks. The study demonstrates that this hybrid method not only retains the simplicity of EMs but also achieves higher accuracy and generalization, offering a reliable tool for tunnel safety monitoring and construction risk management</p>"}]}
