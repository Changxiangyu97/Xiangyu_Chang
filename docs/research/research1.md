The aims of the project will be achieved by developing and implementing a **smart digital-twin framework** for the railroad tunnels, with heterogenous digital modelling and hierarchy data fusion. The conceptual framework is a **closed cyber-physical loop**, including physical structures (i.e., tunnels and physical testbed), cyber counterparts (i.e., surrogate models and physical-based deep learning models), and two interfaces (i.e., information and intervention). The information interface is extracted by **smart sensing systems** and **multi-fidelity model data** from physical tunnels and fed into digital models. The intervention is generated by cyber counterparts and applied on physical tunnels. It is evaluated and selected by engineers for optimized predictive maintenance and rail traffic management.
